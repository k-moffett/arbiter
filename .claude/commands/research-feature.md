```

### Feature-Specific Methodology Research
Tailored implementation approaches based on feature type:

#### Authentication Features
- OAuth 2.0 vs JWT vs session-based approaches
- Multi-factor authentication implementation
- Social login integration patterns
- Password security and hashing methods

#### Recommendation Engines
- Collaborative filtering vs content-based approaches
- Machine learning vs rule-based systems
- Real-time vs batch processing patterns
- Data collection and user behavior tracking

#### Real-time Features
- WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events vs polling
- Message queuing and pub/sub patterns
- Real-time state synchronization approaches
- Scaling real-time connections

### Project Integration Research
When `--project-context` is used:

```
üîó Project Integration Research:
RESEARCH_PROJECT_INTEGRATION: authentication:React Express

üìã Integration Instructions:
STEP 1: COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS
‚Ä¢ Research compatibility of authentication with: React Express
‚Ä¢ Find integration patterns and examples
‚Ä¢ Check for existing plugins or libraries

STEP 2: MIGRATION PLANNING
‚Ä¢ Document required changes to existing codebase
‚Ä¢ Identify new dependencies and their impact
‚Ä¢ Plan database schema changes if needed
```

## Project Context Detection

### Automatic Framework Detection
When `--project-context` is enabled, the command detects:

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
- **React** - from package.json dependencies
- **Vue** - from package.json dependencies  
- **Angular** - from @angular/core in package.json
- **Express** - from express in package.json
- **NestJS** - from @nestjs/core in package.json

#### Python Projects  
- **Flask** - from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- **FastAPI** - from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- **Django** - from requirements.txt or pyproject.toml

### Integration Benefits
- **Compatible recommendations** - Suggests technologies that work with existing stack
- **Migration guidance** - Provides specific integration steps
- **Conflict avoidance** - Identifies potential compatibility issues
- **Leverages existing standards** - Uses initialized coding standards for context

## AI Agent Workflow

### Research Execution Steps
1. **Parse feature description** and classify automatically
2. **Execute WebSearch commands** to find current best practices
3. **Create temporary research files** in `.claude/aiContext/temp_research/`
4. **Compile findings** into structured recommendations
5. **Generate final report** with actionable instructions
6. **Clean up temporary files** after completion

### Research Quality Guidelines
- **Current focus** - All research emphasizes 2024-2025 practices
- **Multiple sources** - Verify recommendations across sources
- **Real-world examples** - Include production implementation cases
- **Actionable instructions** - Provide step-by-step guidance for AI agents
