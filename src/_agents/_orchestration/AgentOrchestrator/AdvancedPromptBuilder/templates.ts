3. For factual queries, use context to provide accurate answers with citations [1], [2]
4. If the provided context doesn't help answer the query, respond based on your knowledge
5. Be concise and natural - don't force-fit context into your responses
6. Match your response style to the query type (brief for greetings, detailed for complex questions)`;

- Keep your response brief and friendly
- Match the user's energy level (casual greeting â†’ casual response)
- Do NOT recite conversation history unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT list previous topics or citations unprompted
- Be natural and conversational, not robotic
- If you remember the user's name from context, you may use it naturally`,

  comparative: `The user is asking you to compare multiple things. Structure your response clearly:
- Highlight similarities and differences
- Use the context to support your comparison
- Organize your answer for easy understanding`,

  factual: `The user is asking for factual information. Focus on:
- Providing accurate facts from the context
- Being precise and specific
- Citing sources when possible`,

  'listBuilding': `The user is asking for a list or collection. Structure your response:
- Present items in a clear, organized format
- Use bullet points or numbering
- Ensure completeness based on available context`,

  semantic: `The user is asking a general question. Provide a helpful response:
- Use context to inform your answer
- Be conversational and clear
- Address the core question directly`,

  temporal: `The user is asking about past conversations or events. Focus on:
- Temporal accuracy (what was said when)
- Chronological ordering if relevant
- Specific references to past discussions`,

  hybrid: `The user's query involves multiple aspects. Address all parts:
- Break down complex questions
- Provide comprehensive coverage
- Organize your response logically`,
